# HoroscopeApp

I have created a Daily Horoscope App using Xcode, focusing on an aesthetically pleasing user interface design. 
Users can easily select their zodiac signs and receive daily horoscope predictions presented in a visually appealing format. 
The app offers smooth navigation and an intuitive user experience, enhancing its usability on various iOS devices.
